        <div class="text-about">ABOUT</div>
        <div class="text1">
          Yasmin currently serves as Chief of Staff for a tech company based in
          San Francisco where she is able to research and develop. In this
          position, she prepares investor and fundraising materials and provides
          data-driven analyses for projects.  <br /><br />In addition to her
          current position, Yasmin responded to the COVID-19 crisis by
          volunteering at Fix The Mask, a nonprofit dedicated to delivering a
          safe, effective, affordable, and comfortable mask design to medical
          professionals and the general public. While volunteering, she utilized
          her vast analytical and research skills to help drive efficiency and
          savings within the organization. 
        </div>
        <div class="text2">
          Before her analyst roles, Yasmin served as a reservoir engineering
          intern and member of the Midway-Sunset Asset Development Team for
          Chevron, where she evaluated oil recovery projects to assess their
          impact. This role was based on her love of engineering. After
          receiving both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Stanford
          University, she majored in Energy Resources Engineering and sought
          immediate employment.
        </div>
        <div class="text3">
          During her time at school, she worked as a department teaching
          assistant and assisted a professor with National Geographic project
          research, furthering her energy resources and engineering interests.
          She also worked as the Vice President for the Society of International
          Affairs at Stanford (SIAS) and the Director of Finance for the
          U.S.-Mexico Forum for Solidarity and Cooperation. <br /><br />Yasmin
          Bashirova is also no stranger to awards. She graduated with Cum Laude
          Honors from Phillips Exeter Academy, was a Stanford McCaw Scholarship
          Recipient, won 2nd place at CSUN AAPG and SPE regional conferences,
          voted the best delegate at the UC Berkeley Model United Nations
          conference, and was awarded 1st Stanford Undergraduate Student from
          Azerbaijan.
        </div>
        <div class="text4">
          Yasmin was born in Baku, Azerbaijan but spent her childhood in
          Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. She was a community leader for the
          Azerbaijanis in Northern California during the Karabakh war of 2020.
          She is currently a volunteer and advocate in support of Ukraine with
          local initiatives. These initiatives are very near to her heart, and
          she has felt a great desire to help those in her childhood country of
          residence who are suffering from the effects of war.
        </div>
        <div class="text5">
          Yasmin is also a passionate volunteer with her limited spare time. She
          assisted the non-profit group, Corazón, in the construction of housing
          for low-income families in Tijuana, Mexico.
          <br /><br />Yasmin Bashirova was also a published photographer in the
          Moscow Times and participated in exhibitions in her spare time. A
          natural-born athlete, Yasmin also runs in her free time and placed
          14th in the New England Division 2 Track and Field Championship.
          Yasmin is also highly active in her San Francisco community, known for
          speaking out for human rights, social justice and paving the way for
          young women to become empowered leaders like herself.
